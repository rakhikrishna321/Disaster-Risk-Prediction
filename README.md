# 🌍 Disaster Prediction and Monitoring System

A machine learning–based application that predicts, monitors, and assesses disaster risks using **KNN** and **CNN** models.  
The system integrates **Django** for the backend and **Flutter** for the frontend to provide real-time predictions, image-based damage analysis, and alert management.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌦️ **Disaster Prediction:** Predicts disaster type using KNN based on weather and elevation data.  
- 🖼️ **Image Risk Classification:** Uses CNN to classify disaster damage as *High* or *Low* risk.  
- 👥 **Role-Based Access:** Separate modules for **Admin**, **ERT**, and **User**.  
- 📡 **Real-Time Data:** Integrates with **WeatherBit** and **Google Elevation APIs**.  
- 💬 **Communication System:** Includes reporting, feedback, grievance, and emergency message modules.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):**  
  Used for disaster prediction based on environmental features like temperature, humidity, rainfall, and elevation.

- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):**  
  Used for classifying disaster images into *High* or *Low* risk categories using image feature extraction.
